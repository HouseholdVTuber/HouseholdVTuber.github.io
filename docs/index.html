<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my little tutorial on setting up the &ldquo;Xenia&rdquo; Xbox 360 emulator! This article is intended to serve as a Getting Started guide, one which takes the least complicated path to running an acceptable 360 emulation experience on your PC.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---download-xenia">Step 1 - Download Xenia</h2>
<p>Unless yours is a special circumstance outside the scope of this article, you&rsquo;ll want to download the latest release of Xenia for Windows. The project is ever-evolving and hosted on Github, so a direct link would likely be deprecated some time after this writing. You can most reliably download the latest release from the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/xenia-project/release-builds-windows">Github repository</a>. Scroll down to the contents of the README.md and you&rsquo;ll see a <em>Latest</em> hyperlink, pictured below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rVfFcZS.png" alt="Link to Latest Xenia"></p>
<p>On the following page, click on the <em>xenia_master.zip</em> file link to start your download. The version tag at the top may differ from this screenshot, but don&rsquo;t be alarmed:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/opVzyCV.png" alt="Current Latest"></p>
<h2 id="step-2---unzip-the-xenia_masterzip-contents">Step 2 - Unzip the xenia_master.zip contents</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the latest <em>xenia_master.zip</em>, you&rsquo;ll need to extract its contents somewhere. Feel free to put these anywhere you want; in this case, I chose to make a &ldquo;xenia&rdquo; folder on the root of my C:\ drive:</p>
<pre><code>C:\xenia
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3q1fKCQ.png" alt="Xenia folder contents"></p>
<p>Your folder doesn&rsquo;t have to be named &ldquo;xenia&rdquo; exactly, but its contents should look like this.</p>
<h2 id="step-3---the-optional-but-very-recommended-portabletxt">Step 3 - The Optional, but Very Recommended Portable.txt</h2>
<p>As of this writing, Xenia does not have a mature GUI. Most of the configuration is done through Notepad++, or whatever text editor you choose, and config files. And while it isn&rsquo;t required, Dear Reader, I advise you to add a &ldquo;portable.txt&rdquo; file to your xenia folder alongside those initial 3 files so that your folder structure looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ytqRtpC.png" alt="Xenia folder contents with Portable.txt"></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to write anything into the file. As long as Xenia detects a <em>portable.txt</em> in its running directory, then it will publish your save files to a &ldquo;content&rdquo; subfolder in this directory (it will make this directory for you when you save something). By default it will try to save your games to that weird forest of app data in your user files; if you&rsquo;ve used Windows a lot in the last decade, you&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m talking about. This can cause issues with certain games and, since Xenia doesn&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;install&rdquo; itself as an application or touch the registry anyway, I think it&rsquo;s cleaner to keep all of your Xenia stuff in one place.</p>
<h2 id="step-4---find-a-game-and-launch-xenia">Step 4 - Find a game and launch Xenia!</h2>
<p>This should be the part where I tell you that I can&rsquo;t actually link to the ISO or ROM images, but to test your Xenia setup, just grab the PAL Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 game .ISO from <a href="https://archive.org/details/sonic-the-hedgehog-2006-xbox-360">The Internet Archive</a>. This game&rsquo;s been delisted from every storefront and Sega seems content to keep it that way, and I trust Archive.org as a host. This page should have a link to download the 7Zip archive, pictured below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bk90Buu.png" alt="7Z Link"></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have 7Zip installed as an archive software, feel free to go download and install it from <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip.org</a>. You may use any file archiver which supports the .7z extension, or source your own ISO. Though when it comes to finding this stuff, be wary of malicious sites. I can&rsquo;t assume responsibility for what happens to your computer if you download Crackdown.iso.exe from a malicious source!</p>
<p>However you go about it, make sure the .ISO image of the game you want to play is placed somewhere that Xenia can open it from (that means, outside of the 7z archive or any similar compression format). Now go ahead and double-click the <em>xenia.exe</em> in your xenia folder!</p>
<h2 id="step-5---open-your-game-iso-with-xenia">Step 5 - Open your game ISO with Xenia</h2>
<p>Xenia will open to a black screen.  Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, just click [File] along the top and then <em>Open&hellip;</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zv5iRty.png" alt="Xenia Start Screen"></p>
<p>&hellip; This will open a Windows File Explorer window. Navigate to your .ISO image (in our case, <em>Sonic the Hedgehog [PAL][NTSCU].iso</em>) and click it.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-troubleshoot-and-enjoy">Step 6: Troubleshoot and Enjoy!</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HjihEPk.png" alt="Sonic Title Screen"></p>
<p>&hellip; And there you go! This concludes the &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; tutorial, but I&rsquo;ll be adding random tips below to help resolve common issues. Assuming your PC has decent &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; specs (I&rsquo;m sporting an old GTX 1070 myself), you shouldn&rsquo;t have to finangle much to get Sonic 2006 running well - or, as well as one can reasonably expect Sonic 2006 to run. You should notice drastically reduced loading times compared to the native hardware experience!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to the first WiiKnow retro-review! The year is 2002, the holiday season is upon us, and Universal Interactive wants their new Spyro game on the shelves <strong>NOW</strong>! Following the success of Spyro&rsquo;s original trilogy on Sony&rsquo;s Playstation, fans were no doubt excited to see what tools the console&rsquo;s successor offered our purple dragon. Though Spyro: Season of Ice and Spyro: Season of Flame had released for Nintendo&rsquo;s Gameboy Advance in the interim since Spyro 3, Enter the Dragonfly would be the fourth &ldquo;mainline&rdquo; entry in the series&hellip; There&rsquo;s a whole history lecture to be had here, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHLZEuyXFKE">Mr. FO1 and tealgamemaster</a> paint the whole story in more complete yet succinct terms than I ever could (in one article).</p>
<p>Rather, this is a review of my own recent experience with Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly. And you can catch the VODs of my 100% playthrough <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1qOUzOGs7Z-gkc76Wu2uAQFnlwyK8Y4q">on my channel</a>. Now, onto the review.:</p>
<h2 id="the-levels">The Levels</h2>
<p>The Dragon Realms serve as Spyro&rsquo;s hub world, dotted with cute, themed entrances to its 8 worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragonfly Dojo</li>
<li>Crop Circle Country</li>
<li>Luau Island</li>
<li>Cloud 9</li>
<li>Monkey Monastery</li>
<li>Honey Marsh</li>
<li>Thieves&rsquo; Den</li>
<li>Jurassic Jungle</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and, that&rsquo;s it! You heard that right - Enter the Dragonfly offers a grand total of 8 worlds to explore on your quest to defeat Ripto. Compared to 2000&rsquo;s Spyro: Year of the Dragonfly&rsquo;s 36 worlds, it&rsquo;s a pitiable (fire, ice, and lightning)breadth of content. The worlds that did make it into the game host a decent amount of geography, collectibles, and nested minigames; they feel like complete levels which never overstay their welcome. Each one is filled with structures and enemies unique to itself with minimal overlap, though there definitely is overlap and some obvious signs of cut or rushed content. For example, there are hidden treasure chests in Monkey Monastery, Honey Marsh, and Jurassic Jungle all decorated with motifs not fitting the world they&rsquo;re found in. And the models for Crop Circle Country&rsquo;s electricity cannons are re-used in Cloud 9. There are more, but these are the ones which obviously stood out to me in my casual playthrough. Most of these levels also make an effort to twist the gameplay! Thieves&rsquo; Den features wizards invulnerable to all methods of attack aside from reflecting their own blasts back at them with your Wing Shield ability (this ability is seldom used beyond that), Luau Island has significant underwater portions, and Honey Marsh&rsquo;s caustic honey flows will have you thinking it&rsquo;s the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;lava&rdquo; level until you reach Jurassic Jungle.</p>
<h2 id="the-gameplay">The Gameplay</h2>
<p>Check Six Studios did a serviceable job recreating the controls players will have come to expect from the franchise: charging, jumping, gliding, hovering, and head bashing are all there and I can count on one hand how many times a failure to glide across a gap or avoid damage felt like a responsibility of the controls. However, that&rsquo;s not to say that it&rsquo;s a terribly tight experience. Spyro often jittered into the air after finishing a ladder climb, crashing onto the ground with an &ldquo;ouch&rdquo; after falling all of one or two feet, and I wrestled with the camera more often and more hopelessly than I remember experiencing with entries both older and newer than Enter the Dragonfly. These quirks simply didn&rsquo;t result in avoiding unnecessary damage because the game is, overall, very easy. Enemies hardly gather in dense swarms and I&rsquo;d wager Ripto&rsquo;s never engaged with anything sporting the term, &ldquo;mixed unit tactics&rdquo;. The minigame challenges were usually a breeze, with a glaring exception in Jurassic Jungle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tower of Scary and Ridiculous Heights&rdquo;. To be fair, it&rsquo;s in the very last level of the game, but it has certainly earned a reputation among those who&rsquo;ve seen this game to the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SO1wOKh.png" alt="&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be back.&amp;rdquo;">
<em>a T-1000 Riptoc, too big to be charged and only vulnerable to Spyro&rsquo;s electric breath</em><br>
<br>
Controls and minigames aside, most levels are built from a collection of large, empty rooms with enemies sparsley placed and occasionally directly blocking your path. It&rsquo;s simple, with a noticeable absence of challenging platform sections you could find off the beaten path in Spyro 1-3. When the level designers managed to construct a decently tuned platform challenge, it was often labeled a minigame and containerized within a sublevel. Very rarely was a platform or combat challenge integrated neatly into a world&rsquo;s geometry.</p>
<p>The main gimmick of the game is Spyro&rsquo;s ability to use multiple breaths beyond his trademark Fire Breath, and they are: Bubble Breath, Ice Breath, and Electric Breath. Likely a symptom of the sheer amount of content left on Check Six&rsquo;s cutting room floor, the implementation of each one doesn&rsquo;t amount to much; I can safely list every scenario in which they each need to be used while keeping this review succinct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bubble Breath
<ul>
<li>used exclusively to catch Dragonflies. <em>Its effective range is much shorter than what the animation would imply and the need for it creates more frustration than there otherwise would be if you could just tackle these to collect them</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Electric Breath
<ul>
<li>The T-Rex 1000 enemies in Jurassic Jungle can only be damaged by it. <em>If you&rsquo;re not going for 100% you can just run around these</em></li>
<li>Activates mechanisms involving lightning rods</li>
<li>Opens a gate in the hub which blocks your path to Crop Circle Country, Luau Island, and Honey Marsh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ice Breath
<ul>
<li>The R-1000 enemies in Jurassic Jungle can only be defeated by freezing and charging into them. <em>Also can just be avoided if you aren&rsquo;t going for 100%</em></li>
<li>Needed to freeze three toddler dragons in the Dragonfly Dojo in order to retrieve their kites</li>
<li>Opens a gate in the hub which blocks your path to Monkey Monastery, Thieves&rsquo; Den, and Jurassic Jungle</li>
<li>Needed to remove Ripto&rsquo;s fire shield in the final fight</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
&nbsp;
Other than in the above scenarios, Ice Breath is there for when you want to add an extra step to killing enemies and lightning breath functions like a fire breath reskin. That said, most enemies have a unique "I'm getting zapped" animation to go with it and I think that's a nice touch.
<h2 id="the-presentation">The Presentation</h2>
<p>I have the least to say about the music so I&rsquo;ll get it out of the way quickly: it is solid. Stewart Copeland again delivers a soundtrack with beats and tunes befitting the environments they echo around in. None of the tracks stood out to me as a series favorite, but I didn&rsquo;t detect any stinkers either. Audio-wise, the faults of this game largely lay in often-enough off sync sound cues, jarringly mixed sound effects, and even errant lines which laughably shipped with the final product.</p>
<p>The world of Enter the Dragonfly&rsquo;s textures were fairly outdated when the game released, and many walls seem too undecorated for how much of the screen&rsquo;s real estate they occupy. It is obvious, however, that some love went into picking a bouncy and colorful pallette reflective of the series&rsquo; lighthearted nature. I also enjoyed each level&rsquo;s motif, from Dragonfly Dojo&rsquo;s cute kung-fu myriad movie references, to Luau Island&rsquo;s (adorable) Riptoc Tourists who excitedly sniff the ground before rearing back and snapping a few photos of&hellip; whatever they&rsquo;re seeing. And as mentioned before, each level hardly recycles assets.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TFSWweL.png" alt="&amp;ldquo;The ending of that one Jet Li movie but instead of dying he turns into a lizard after drinking that spiked tea&amp;rdquo;"></p>
<h2 id="the-verdict---410">The Verdict - 4/10</h2>
<p>It is and always was a 4/10 game. It can safely be 100%&rsquo;d over a weekend thanks to sporting only 8 proper levels. There aren&rsquo;t any particularly memorable challenges - and the ones that are, are memorable for the frustration they inspired. The graphics are okay, nothing spectacular, with most of the points coming from inherent art direction. The game is also eager to drop its framerate throughout your adventure across what vistas Enter the Dragonfly does have to offer.</p>
<p>The legacy of Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly is a sad one, a story of an encumbered at best, and at worst outright abused developer team. And the game plays just like that. It&rsquo;s a whole bunch of unnecessary re-do&rsquo;s imposed by the publisher, unfulfilled promises, broken builds, hungry men sleeping at their desk and living off of peanut butter for days at a time, all miraculously patched together and shipped in a playable state.</p>
