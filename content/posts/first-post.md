## Heading
This is my very first post using the **hugo** framework! I won't try to make it read particularly well or flow any sort of story, but for now I'm going to use it as a miscellaneous note-taking page for the project

&nbsp;
#### Post Notes
* Getting Sonic '06 Running w/ Xenia, solutions to common runtime issues (e.g. F4 to reload graphics cache and fix vertex explosions)
* Pokemon romhack reviews

#### To start local server...
    hugo server -D
#### To create a post...
    hugo new posts/[post name].md

#### Committing changes...
    hugo
    git add .
    git commit -m "what'd you do"
    git push
