## Heading
This is my very first post using the **hugo** framework! I won't try to make it read particularly well or flow any sort of story, but for now I'm going to use it as a miscellaneous note-taking page for the project...

I might turn this into a simple site that aggregates some neat RSS feeds

    If I tab it looks like this
&nbsp;
#### Post Ideas
* Getting Sonic '06 Running w/ Xenia, solutions to common runtime issues (e.g. F4 to reload graphics cache and fix vertex explosions)
* Competitive Pokemon highlights
* Thoughtpost on a recent game. Especially Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly, I've got some to say about that

#### To add a post...
    hugo new posts/[post name].md
