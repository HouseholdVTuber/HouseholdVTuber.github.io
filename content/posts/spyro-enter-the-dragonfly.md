# Preamble
Hello and welcome to the first WiiKnow retro-review! The year is 2002, the holiday season is upon us, and Universal Interactive wants their new Spyro game on the shelves **NOW**! Following the success of Spyro's original trilogy on Sony's Playstation, fans were no doubt excited to see what tools the console's successor offered our purple dragon. Though Spyro: Season of Ice and Spyro: Season of Flame had released for Nintendo's Gameboy Advance in the interim since Spyro 3, Enter the Dragonfly would be the fourth "mainline" entry in the series... There's a whole history lecture to be had here, but [Mr. FO1 and tealgamemaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHLZEuyXFKE) paint the whole story in more complete yet succinct terms than I ever could (in one article).

Rather, this is a review of my own recent experience with Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly. And you can catch the VODs of my 100% playthrough [on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1qOUzOGs7Z-gkc76Wu2uAQFnlwyK8Y4q). Now, onto the review.:

## The Setting
The Dragon Realms serve as Spyro's hub world, dotted with cute, themed entrances to its 8 worlds:
* Dragonfly Dojo
* Crop Circle Country
* Luau Island
* Cloud 9
* Monkey Monastery
* Honey Marsh
* Thieves Den
* Jurassic Jungle

... and, that's it! You heard that right - Enter the Dragonfly offers a grand total of 8 worlds to explore on your quest to defeat Ripto. Compared to 2000's Spyro: Year of the Dragonfly's 36 worlds, it's a pitiable (fire)breadth of content.
